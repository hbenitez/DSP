# DSP
The Python functions for my signal processing under-graduate course include application-oriented programming excercises on Fourier analysis and digital filters design.  (Finite impulse reponse (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR)) 

(1) Discrete Fourier Transform
(2) Discrete Fourier Transform-Autotuner application
(3) SignalCodificationDecodification
(4) FilteringBioAcousticSignals
